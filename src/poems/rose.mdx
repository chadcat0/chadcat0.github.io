If the moments of joy and beauty

Were streched to an eternity

Would their "eternal" lustre slowly fade

And lose the spark, they one had made?


A rose with it's beauty divine

A color or deep, like an aged wine

Would we still fall down to our knees

If its beauty lasted for an eternity?


It took months of to and fro

And ardous work, for the rose to grow

Would it still make out minds enthrall?

If it did not take any labour at all



The garderner who took utmost care

Perfecting a rose, for us to stare

Would we smile at the rose everyday?

If there existed an easier way



Soon, autumn's entry will be made

The petals will fall and colors fade

Would we still think of the beauty of the rose

If it existed as long as time goes?
